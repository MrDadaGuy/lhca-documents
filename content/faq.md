{{< faq-item question="Who can use the park?" >}}
Access Rights:  A person might have access to the property based on their LHCA Membership, or “Deeded Access”, both, or neither.
<br/><br/>
A person or household may be eligible to use the property if:
<ul>
    <li> They own property within the Membership boundary area, and they have an active membership in good standing with LHCA</li>
    <li> They rent property from a member and the member has paid a membership Tenant Transfer Fee </li>
    <li> They own property within the Deeded Access boundary area</li>
    <li> They are a guest of a member who is present</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
It is important to note that the Membership Boundary Area and the Deeded Access Boundary Area are distinct; there is considerable overlap but the difference is that the Members can vote to change the Membership area but Deeded Access boundary was created by easements on the park property itself.
<br/><br/>
The Membership boundaries and membership eligibility criteria are defined in the By Laws, which permits the membership to decide changes to the boundaries. Such extensions to membership boundary get proposed from time to time in the annual ballot.
<br/><br/>
Membership is capped and there is often a wait list to get a membership position in the association.
<ul>
    <li> Members can use the entire park and the improvements (parking areas, club house, pool, etc.)</li>
    <li> Deeded Access holders from Sections 1, 2, and 3 can use "the portion of the Property fronting on Lake Austin and extending back from the lake to a point fifty feet North of the J.F. Clark easement line as reflected by Volume 275, Page 80, of the Deed Records of Travis County", and the westernmost 303 feet of the property.</li>
    <li> Deeded Access holders from the 826 acres can use the westernmost 303 feet of the property.</li>
    <li> Deeded Access holders are not entitled to the use of the improvements.  Use is limited to having picnics, swimming, and for launching and
    landing boats (but not for parking trucks or trailers on the property).</li>
    <li> Deeded Access rights do not extend to guests, vehicles, or pets.</li>
    <li> All visitors to the park are obligated to obey the park rules and by-laws</li>
</ul>

{{< faq-item question="Deeded Access?  Easement?" >}}
<ul>
<li> Deeded Access rights generally refer to Easements on the park property itself. Contrary to some misunderstanding, it is irrelevant whether your property deed has any reference to the park property. What matters is what legal rights are bound up with the park property itself.</li>
<li> An easement is a type of property right; it is a legal encumbrance that runs with a parcel of land, in this case, some neighboring properties carry the right to enter parts or all of the Park property.</li>
<li> An easement is a right to use, access, or traverse one piece of property that is granted to another person or another parcel of property. </li>
<li>In this case, early developers of the area decided that “Lot 4” should be reserved and access rights provided to lure buyers to adjoining tracts to increase their appeal / value.</ul>
